# Chemify Lab Analytics

_A data-driven solution for optimising lab efficiency_

## 📌 Project Overview

Chemify is creating a digital chemical future where the access to important molecules, drugs and new materials, currently unimaginable, are instantly accessible. 

By developing the world's most efficient, automated and versatile chemical manufacturing laboratory, Chemify will radically increase the speed of innovation and contribute to the quality of life for the benefit of humanity

This project aligns with that vision by:
✅ Cleaning and synchronising lab experiment data from multiple sources
✅ Analysing experiment success rates, chemical usage, and costs
✅ Creating an AI-powered dashboard for lab analytics

## 📂 Datasets

This project uses synthetic lab experiment logs that simulate real-world challenges:
1️⃣ Lab Notebook Data: Manually recorded experiments (missing values, inconsistencies).
2️⃣ IoT Sensor Logs: Automated experiment data (unit mismatches, errors).
3️⃣ Procurement Reports: Chemical order history (cost analysis).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (for structured data management)
- Flask/Dash (to build an interactive WebApp)
- Machine Learning (for predictive analysis)


## 🏆 Key Features

🚀 Automated Data Cleaning & Synchronization
📊 Real-time Lab Performance Dashboard
💰 Cost & Resource Optimization Analysis
